        You can get your school and sports physicals done at Anodyne of
        Westerville. We can usually get you scheduled for a same-day or
        next-day appointment, unlike many primary care doctors. Also called
        pre-participation physicals, sport physicals are a great way to make
        sure an athlete can safely play. Even if the state or school
        doesn&rsquo;t require it, sports physicals provide an opportunity to
        discuss any concerns, perform injury prevention screenings, and
        complete a sport-specific physical risk assessment.
