      <p>
        The Carpal Canal connects your hand to your forearm. Carpal Tunnel
        Syndrome occurs when one or more of the tendons in your Carpal Canal
        swell or degenerate, which causes the median nerve becoming trapped or
        squeezed, which leads to the pain and discomfort associated with
        Carpal Tunnel. Typical symptoms include aching, stiffness, and
        weakness in the hands, especially at night.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Signs of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Numbness or tingling in the thumb, index, and middle fingers</li>
        <li>Weak grip strength or difficulty holding small objects</li>
        <li>Pain that worsens at night or after repetitive wrist motion</li>
        <li>A pins-and-needles sensation that radiates up toward the forearm</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What Causes Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</h2>
      <p>
        Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is often linked to repetitive hand and wrist
        motions, awkward wrist positioning, and prolonged pressure on the
        median nerve. Certain health factors—including pregnancy, diabetes,
        thyroid conditions, and rheumatoid arthritis—can also increase your
        risk by contributing to swelling within the carpal canal.
      </p>
