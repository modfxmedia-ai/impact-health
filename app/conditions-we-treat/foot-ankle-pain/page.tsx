      <p>
        The human foot is a complex structure packed tightly with twenty-six
        bones and numerous joints, muscles, nerves, and ligaments. Feet are
        easily injured due to the cramped nature of everything within, as
        well as the relatively fragile bones. Foot pain, just like all pain,
        can be chronic or acute. Sometimes cases of acute foot pain can be
        treated with home care treatments. The chronic and extreme cases of
        foot pain almost always require medical attention. When left
        untreated, chronic, and sometimes acute, foot pain can lead to
        long-term issues such as numbness in the foot or a walking impairment.
