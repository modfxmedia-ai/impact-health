      <h2>Understanding Back Pain</h2>
      <p>
        Back pain is one of the world’s leading causes of disability—and one
        of the most common reasons for doctor’s office visits. In fact, as
        many as 75% – 85% of Americans will experience back pain at some point
        in their lives. Your pain may be concentrated in a region of your neck
        or back, or may radiate down to your legs.
      </p>
      <p>
        You also may find that your pain worsens with movement like walking,
        lifting, bending, and twisting. For some people, back pain can be
        debilitating—impacting sleep, activity level, and emotional
        well-being.
      </p>
      <p>Your back and neck pain can have many different causes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Trauma from a sports injury or accident</li>
        <li>Irritated or inflamed nerves</li>
        <li>Ruptured discs</li>
        <li>Muscle strains</li>
        <li>Ligament sprains</li>
        <li>In some cases, a more serious condition like infection or cancer</li>
      </ul>
