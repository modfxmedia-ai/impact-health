      <p>
        Hip Pain is most often felt in the muscles or joints that make up the
        hip/pelvic region. Hip Pain is described as a shooting pain, weakness
        and/or stiffness in the hip. Hip Pain can be caused by any number of
        factors, most notably Rheumatoid Arthritis and Osteoarthritis.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Causes of Hip Pain</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis in the hip joint</li>
        <li>Bursitis or tendinitis around the hip</li>
        <li>Muscle strain from overuse or sudden movement</li>
        <li>Hip labral tears affecting joint stability</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When Hip Pain Needs Professional Care</h2>
      <p>
        Hip pain that limits walking, disrupts sleep, or doesn&apos;t improve with
        rest is a sign your hip needs a proper evaluation rather than
        continued home management.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Choose Impact for Hip Pain Treatment</h2>
      <p>
        Our providers combine chiropractic care, physical therapy, and
        regenerative medicine to relieve pressure on the hip joint and
        rebuild strength—so you can move without pain, without surgery.
