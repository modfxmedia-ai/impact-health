      <p>
        Neck Pain, although felt in the neck, can be caused by problems
        related to the spinal cord. This means Neck Pain can be caused by
        tight muscles in the upper back as well as in the neck. Joints in the
        neck and upper back can stiffen and cause neck pain as well. The most
        common long-term cause for neck pain is osteoarthritis, and this
        results in the neck being the most common area for spinal surgery.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Causes of Neck Pain</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Poor posture from desk work, driving, or phone use</li>
        <li>Muscle strain or overuse in the neck and upper back</li>
        <li>Herniated or bulging discs in the cervical spine</li>
        <li>Whiplash injuries from car accidents or falls</li>
        <li>Osteoarthritis affecting the joints of the neck</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When to Seek Treatment for Neck Pain</h2>
      <p>
        Neck pain that lasts more than a few days, limits your range of
        motion, or radiates into your shoulders and arms is a sign it&apos;s time
        to seek professional care. Left untreated, chronic neck pain can lead
        to worsening joint degeneration over time.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Choose Impact for Neck Pain Relief</h2>
      <p>
        Impact&apos;s providers combine chiropractic adjustments, spinal
        decompression, and physical therapy to relieve pressure on the neck
        and restore mobility—addressing the root cause rather than just
        masking the symptoms.
