      <p>
        Shoulder Pain can affect the joint itself, the surrounding muscles,
        or the tendons and ligaments that keep the shoulder stable. Because
        the shoulder has such a wide range of motion, it&apos;s especially
        vulnerable to overuse injuries, joint degeneration, and soft-tissue
        strain that can make everyday movements like reaching or lifting
        difficult and painful.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Causes of Shoulder Pain</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Rotator cuff strain, tendinitis, or tears</li>
        <li>Frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis)</li>
        <li>Bursitis or impingement in the shoulder joint</li>
        <li>Osteoarthritis affecting the shoulder joint</li>
        <li>Overuse injuries from repetitive lifting, throwing, or reaching</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When to Seek Treatment for Shoulder Pain</h2>
      <p>
        Shoulder pain that limits your range of motion, disrupts sleep, or
        persists for more than a few weeks is a sign your shoulder needs a
        proper evaluation. Catching the underlying cause early can help you
        avoid further joint damage and a longer recovery down the road.
      </p>
