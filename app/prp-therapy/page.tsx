    question: "What are the side effects of PRP therapy?",
    answer:
      "While PRP therapy is generally considered safe due to the use of your own blood, minimizing the risk of allergic reactions, some patients may experience mild side effects. These can include temporary pain or discomfort at the injection site, swelling, bruising and, in rare cases, infection. However, these side effects are typically short-lived and resolve on their own.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to see results from PRP therapy?",
    answer:
      "The time frame for seeing results from PRP therapy can vary depending on the individual and the condition being treated. Generally, patients may begin to notice improvements within a few weeks of treatment, with more significant results appearing after several months. Multiple sessions may be necessary to achieve optimal outcomes.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are PRP injections painful?",
    answer:
      "The discomfort level during PRP injections can vary from person to person. While some may only feel a mild pressure or discomfort, others might find the injections slightly more painful. Local anesthetic is often used to minimize pain during the procedure, making it tolerable for most patients.",

  },
  {
    title: "Procedure",
    description:
      "On the day of your procedure, a small blood sample is drawn from your arm, similar to a routine blood test. This sample is then placed in a centrifuge to separate and concentrate the platelets from the red blood cells, creating the platelet-rich plasma. The PRP is then carefully injected into the treatment area, targeting the specific tissues that require healing or rejuvenation. The entire procedure usually takes less than an hour, with minimal discomfort.",
  },
  {
    title: "Recovery",
    description:
      "Recovery from PRP therapy is typically swift, with most patients returning to their daily activities immediately. You may experience mild soreness or swelling at the injection site, but these symptoms are temporary and generally resolve within a few days.",
  },
  {
    title: "Follow-ups",
    description:
      "Follow-up appointments are scheduled to monitor your progress and ensure optimal healing. Depending on your individual case, additional PRP sessions may be recommended to achieve the best results. Throughout each step, our team at Impact Health & Wellness is committed to providing support and guidance, ensuring a smooth and effective treatment process.",
  },
  {
    title: "Results",
    description:
      "PRP therapy offers a remarkable opportunity to experience both immediate and progressive improvements in your condition. As your body utilizes the concentrated growth factors in the PRP injection, expect to see continued benefits over several weeks, including tissue regeneration, reduced inflammation, and long-lasting pain relief and functional restoration. The timeframe for achieving optimal results can vary depending on the individual and the treated condition.",

      <h2>What is PRP Therapy?</h2>
      <p>
        PRP therapy involves concentrating platelets from your own blood
        using a centrifuge, then re-injecting this platelet-rich plasma into
        areas of the body that require healing. This concentration of
        platelets, rich in growth factors and proteins, stimulates tissue
        regeneration, collagen production and accelerates the healing of
        injured tendons, ligaments, muscles and joints. It’s a cornerstone
        of regenerative medicine that taps into the body’s inherent
        abilities to heal itself.
