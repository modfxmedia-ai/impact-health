      <h2>What is Chiropractic Care?</h2>
      <p>
        Chiropractic Care involves the diagnosis and manipulative treatment of
        misalignments of the joints, particularly those of the spinal column,
        which are believed to cause other disorders by affecting the nerves,
        muscles, and organs. This non-invasive, drug-free approach focuses on
        manual adjustments and manipulations to improve overall health and
        alleviate pain.
