      <h2>Chiropractic Care for Infants</h2>
      <p>
        During the process of labor and delivery, a tremendous amount of
        stress is placed on the baby&apos;s spine. Therefore, there is great
        potential for the bones of the spine to misalign, resulting in
        subluxations. If subluxations occur in a newborn, there is greater
        chance they will have trouble breast feeding, trouble digesting
        food, and recurring infections.{" "}
        <a href="/chiropractic-care/">Chiropractic adjustments</a> for
        newborns are very gentle and created specifically to prevent these
        problems and to allow the nervous system to function at its optimal
        level.
      </p>

      <h2>Chiropractic Care During Pregnancy</h2>
      <p>
        Chiropractic care is vital for the normal physiological function
        for both the baby and the mother during pregnancy and birth. If a
        subluxation is present during pregnancy, it will interrupt vital
        nerve flow within a mother&apos;s body and to the developing baby.
        Chiropractic care during pregnancy is designed to eliminate
        subluxations, open nerve pathways, and decrease stress on the
        mother and baby.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Webster technique is a specific chiropractic adjustment for
        pregnant mothers. This technique is used to relieve the causes of
        intrauterine restraint prior to the delivery. Other benefits of
        chiropractic care during pregnancy are reduced labor time, reduced
        chance of a cesarean birth, less pain during labor, and to
        alleviate common discomforts. Having a chiropractic care plan
        during pregnancy significantly effects the pregnancy experience.
