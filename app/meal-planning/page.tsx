        At Impact Health &amp; Wellness, we believe in the power of
        sustainable lifestyle changes to achieve and maintain optimal health.

        roadmap tailored to your unique needs and preferences.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Calorie needs:</strong> Based on your individual goals and
          activity level, we determine the appropriate calorie intake for
          sustainable weight management or overall health optimization.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dietary restrictions:</strong> We cater to various dietary
          needs, including gluten-free, paleo, and others, ensuring your
          plan is safe and effective.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Food preferences:</strong> We incorporate your favorite
          foods and flavors to create a plan you&rsquo;ll enjoy and stick to
          long-term.
        </li>
      </ul>
