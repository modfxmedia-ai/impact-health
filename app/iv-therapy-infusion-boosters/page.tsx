      <p>
        IV therapy is a terrific delivery method for vitamins and fluids
        that your body craves. Because it&rsquo;s intravenous, the
        absorption rate of these fluids is much greater than you get via
        digestion. We offer two varieties of IV therapy &ndash; infusions
        and booster injections.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          We currently cannot provide IV infusion services to anyone that is
          pregnant (without a doctor note stating otherwise) or under the
          age of 18. Our infusion services are not meant to diagnose or
          treat any illness or disease.
