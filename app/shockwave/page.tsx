      <p>
        Shockwave therapy, also known as extracorporeal shockwave therapy
        (ESWT), is a highly effective treatment that uses sound waves to
        promote healing in injured tissues. These sound waves increase
        blood flow, stimulate the body’s natural healing processes and
        break down scar tissue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shockwave therapy has been shown to safely and effectively treat a
        number of conditions including tendonitis, plantar fasciitis,
        tennis elbow and rotator cuff injuries. By addressing the root
        cause of pain and dysfunction, ESWT offers a significant
        improvement in quality of life for those suffering from chronic
        musculoskeletal conditions.
